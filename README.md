## Future Laravel backend to my [website](https://nathanjms.co.uk). 

### Setup:

*Coming Soon*
### Features include:

A logged in user can access the Movies api, which can:
- Retrieve list of movies belonging to the user's group
- Add movies to the user's group's watch list 
- Mark movies as 'seen'
- See list of movies on watchlist and movies that have been watched
- ~~See top IMDB Movies~~ (Removed for now)
- Coming Soon: Add Ratings to watcvhed movies!

Backend will be hosted on Heroku once set up with the front end, and will replace the current node.js setup.
