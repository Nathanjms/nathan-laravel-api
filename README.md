## Future Laravel backend to my [website](https://nathanjms.co.uk). 

### Setup:

*Coming Soon*
### Features include:

A logged in user can access the Movies api, where they can:
- Add movies to watch
- Mark movies as watched
- See list of movies on watchlist and movies that have been watched
- ~~See top IMDB Movies~~ (Removed for now)
- Random movie selector (Now implemented!)

Backend will be hosted on Heroku once set up.
